# indexingnotation
Human readable reusable indexing notation for tensor operations.

The relics of the past - fortran-like numpy and its derivatives equipped with autodiff (pytorch, tensorflow, etc)
 - will be inevitably replaced by a better and more expressive notation for tensor operations. 
 
 Named axes finally bring reusability and readability into the code.
